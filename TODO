Flesh out the meetings function
- I've generated a meetings scaffold and want to have a facility to record details about meetings like members who attended and what was discussed and links to any resources
- play around with the datepicker - what about time? and customising the datepicker, maybe make it inline
- topics should probably be a nested resource of meetings
- fix validation/errors for adding new topics on the edit meetings view
- probably remove jrails plugin and stop using rails js helpers (which are obtrusive) and go for something more unobtrusive
- implement OpenID authentication system for admin editing of meeting info
-- maybe make it really simple, only used by admins for now (maybe for members when there is commenting)
-- only display on meetings page and it is simply a login as admins are already signed up
- add a commenting function for meetings
- provide mechanism for hosting and playing slides of presentations either on the site or through a third party service
- add a mapping facility that allows meeting locations to be graphically presented
- allow for upload of images for a meeting/event
