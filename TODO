Flesh out the meetings function
- I've generated a meetings scaffold and want to have a facility to record details about meetings like members who attended and what was discussed and links to any resources
- play around with the datepicker - what about time? and customising the datepicker, maybe make it inline
- topics should probably be a nested resource of meetings
