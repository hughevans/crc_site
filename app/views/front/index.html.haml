%h1 What's Going On Here?
%p 
  This is the early beginnings of the Canberra Ruby Crew site which will evolve as we hack on it at our monthly meetings making it do all sorts of crazy and cool things. Right now it does zip all, but you can change that by forking it on
  = link_to 'github', 'http://github.com/artpop/crc_site'
  and sending me a pull request if you want to see your changes go live:

%pre
  git://github.com/artpop/crc_site.git

  Check out our
  %a{:href => commits_path} hacks pages

  = link_to 'mailing list is', 'http://groups.google.com/group/canberra-ruby'
